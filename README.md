# Sargam
Sargam is an Indian music software notation tool.
Details, screenshots and download are available [here](https://sargamdev.wordpress.com/)

## Note about the codebase
Sargam was initially developped as a prototype and features were gradually added to investigate the ideas for an indian music notation tool. With time, it became obvious that the internal data structure is limited and does not model nicely indian notation. Nontheless, the software is quite usable.

## future
A complete rewrite is underway to address the internal structure issues wich causes maintenance and enhancement limitations. The rewrite will lead to Sargam 2.0.
